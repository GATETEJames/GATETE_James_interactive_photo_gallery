COA TASKFORCE Take Home

My repository contains my submission for the COA TASKFORCE Take Home Challenge. The challenge includes building an interactive photo gallery and solving two coding challenges using JavaScript.

**Interactive Photo Gallery** more instructions:

Clone the repository to your machine:

```
git clone GATETE_James_interactive_photo_gallery
```

Navigate to the project directory: `challenges`

then go in ui-challenge Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the interactive photo gallery. Open the `index.js` file to see the interactive gallery structure, location, and all approach details.

**HTML Structure:** I used the provided Figma designs to create the HTML structure for the photo gallery. Each image is wrapped in a `<div>` element with appropriate classes for styling and interaction.

**CSS Styling:** I used CSS to style the gallery elements, ensuring pixel-perfect accuracy with the Figma designs. Media queries were implemented to ensure responsiveness across different screen sizes and mobile devices.

**JavaScript Interactivity:** JavaScript was used to implement interactivity features such as image navigation and hover interactions. Additional details are displayed when a user hovers over a photo, as specified in the Figma prototype.

The `ui` directory contains: `index.html` and `index.js`.

Navigate to the Challenges directory:

**Coding Challenges**

Open the `arrayMap.js` and `stringTransform.js` files in your preferred code editor to view the solutions.

**Approach:**

**Array Manipulation (`arrayMap.js`):** I implemented a function to determine if there exists a contiguous subarray within an array that sums up to the target. The solution follows the provided problem statement and constraints, achieving the expected time and space complexity.

**String Transformation (`stringTransform.js`):** I set a function to transform a string based on the provided rules. The solution handles all possible cases mentioned in the problem statement and achieves the expected time and space complexity.
